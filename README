README
-----------------------------
This code was forked from the official redis-tools repository on March 28,2012.
The source for this can be found at: https://github.com/antirez/redis-tools

Building
-----------------------------
To compile, simply:
make clean
make

Running 
----------------------------
The only reason this was forked was to add a -s parameter to both redis-stat and redis-load.

The -s parameter allows you to specify a unix socket in place of a TCP socket to execute, exactly like redis-cli

e.g.
./redis-stat -s /tmp/redisunix.sock

as long as you have the following in your redis.conf file

unixsocket /tmp/redisunix.sock


Good luck!
